# Virtualization (虚拟化)
 
## Benefits of Virtualization
* Effective way to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for all size businesses
* Reduce capital and operating costs
* Minimize or eliminate downtime
* Increase IT productivity, efficiency, agility and responsiveness.
* Provision applications and resources faster.
* Enable business continuity and disaster recovery.
* Simplify data center management
* Build a true Software-Defined Data Center.

## How virtualization Works
* Virtualization uses software to simulate the existence of hardware and create a virtual computer system.
* Doning this allows businesses to run more than one virtual system and multiple operating systems and applciations on a single server.
* This can provide economies of scale and greater efficiency.

## The Virtual Machine
* A virtual computer system
A tightly isolated software container with an operating system and application inside.
* Each self-contained VM is completely independent.
* Putting multiple VMs on a single computer enables several os and apps to run on just one physical server, or "host".

### Hypervisor
A thin layer of software called a **Hypervisor** decouples the VMs from the host and dynamically allocates computing resources to each VM as needed.

Hypervisor is what you install on the server to let you run vms.

## Key Properties of VMs
* Partitioning
  * run multiple os on one physical machine
  * divedde system resources betweeen virtual machines
* isolation
  * provide fault and security isolation at the harware level
  * preserve performance with advanced resource controls
* Encapsulation
  * Save the entire state of a virtual machine to files
  * Move and copy vms as easily as movign and copying files
* Hardware Independence
  * Provision or migrate any virtual machine to any physical server.

## Server Consolidation
Using server virtualization, a company can maixize the use of its server reources and reduce the number of servers required. The result is server consolidation, which improves efficiency and cuts costs.
